  <title>Test of very long title. This is a test! 1. Four Point Six Archaean horizon
 The first sunrise On a pristine Gaea Opus perfectum Somewhere there, us sleeping
 "After sleeping through a hundred million centuries we have finally opened our eyes on a sumptuous planet, sparkling with color, bountiful with life. Within decades we must close our eyes again. Isn't it a noble, an enlightened way of spending our brief time in the sun, to work at understanding the universe and how we have come to wake up in it?"
 2. Life

 The cosmic law of gravity
 Pulled the newborns around a fire
 A careless, cold infinity 
 In every vast direction

 Lonely farer in the Goldilocks zone
 She has a tale to tell
 From the stellar nursery into a carbon feast 
 Enter Luca 

 The tapestry of chemistry
 There's a writing in the garden
 Leading us to a mother of all

 We are one
 We are a universe
 Forebears of what will be 
 Scions of the Devonian sea
 Aeons path
 Writing the tell of us all 
 A day-to-day new opening 
 For the greatest show on Earth

 Ions channels
 Welcoming the outside world 
 To the stuff of stars 
 Bedding the tree of a biological holy
 Enter life

 The tapestry of chemistry
 There's a writing in the garden
 Leading us to a mother of all

 We are one
 We are a universe
 Forebears of what will be 
 Scions of the Devonian sea
 Aeons path
 Writing the tell of us all 
 A day-to-day new opening 
 For the greatest show on Earth

 We are here to care for the garden
 The wonder of birth 
 Of every form most beautiful

 We are one
 We are a universe
 Forebears of what will be 
 Scions of the Devonian sea
 Aeons path
 Writing the tell of us all 
 A day-to-day new opening 
 For the greatest show on Earth

 3. The Toolmaker

 After a billion years 
 The show is still here
 Not a single one of your fathers died young
 The handy travelers out of Africa
 Little Lucy of the afar</title>
