  <title>Test of very long title. This is a test! 1. Four Point Six Archaean horizon
 The first sunrise On a pristine Gaea Opus perfectum Somewhere there, us sleeping 
 "After sleeping through a hundred million centuries we have finally opened our eyes on a sumptuous planet, sparkling with color, bountiful with life. Within decades we must close our eyes again. Isn't it a noble, an enlightened way of spending our brief time in the sun, to work at understanding the universe and how we have come to wake up in it?"
  2. Life

 The cosmic law of gravity
 Pulled the newborns around a fire
 A careless, cold infinity 
 In every vast direction

 Lonely farer in the Goldilocks zone
 She has a tale to tell
 From the stellar nursery into a carbon feast 
 Enter Luca 

 The tapestry of chemistry
 There's a writing in the garden
 Leading us to a mother of all

 We are one
 We are a universe
 Forebears of what will be 
 Scions of the Devonian sea
 Aeons path
 Writing the tell of us all 
 A day-to-day new opening 
 For the greatest show on Earth

 Ions channels
 Welcoming the outside world 
 To the stuff of stars 
 Bedding the tree of a biological holy
 Enter life

 The tapestry of chemistry
 There's a writing in the garden
 Leading us to a mother of all

 We are one
 We are a universe
 Forebears of what will be 
 Scions of the Devonian sea
 Aeons path
 Writing the tell of us all 
 A day-to-day new opening 
 For the greatest show on Earth

 We are here to care for the garden
 The wonder of birth 
 Of every form most beautiful

 We are one
 We are a universe
 Forebears of what will be 
 Scions of the Devonian sea
 Aeons path
 Writing the tell of us all 
 A day-to-day new opening 
 For the greatest show on Earth

 3. The Toolmaker

 After a billion years 
 The show is still here
 Not a single one of your fathers died young
 The handy travelers out of Africa
 Little Lucy of the afar

 Gave birth to fantasy
 To idolatry
 To self destructive weaponry
 Enter the god of gaps
 Deep within the past
 Atavistic dread of the hunted

 Enter Ionia
 The cradle of thought
 The architecture of understanding
 The human lust to feel so exceptional
 To rule the Earth

 Hunger for shiny rocks 
 For giant mushroom clouds
 The will to do just you'd be done by
 Enter history
 The grand finale
 Enter ratkind

 Man, he took his time in the sun
 Had a dream to understand
 A single grain of sand
 He gave birth to poetry
 But one day'll cease to be
 Greet the last light of the library

 But one day'll cease to be

 We were here!
 We were here!
 We were here!
 We were here!

  4. Understanding.

 We are going to die, and that makes us the lucky ones. Most people are never going to die because they are never going to be born. The potential people who could have been here in my place but who will in fact never see the light of day outnumber the sand grains of Sahara. Certainly those unborn ghosts include greater poets than Keats, scientists greater than Newton. We know this because the set of possible people allowed by our DNA so massively exceeds the set of actual people. In the teeth of these stupefying odds it is you and I, in our ordinariness, that are here.We privileged few, who won the lottery of birth against all odds, how dare we whine at our inevitable return to that prior state from which the vast majority have never stirred?

 There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.

	Last Ride Of The Day

We live in every moment but this one
Why don`t we recognize the faces loving us so

What`s God if not the spark that started life
Smile of a stranger
Sweet music, starry skies
Wonder, mystery, wherever my road goes
Early wake-ups in a moving home
Scent of fresh-mown grass in the morning sun
Open theme park gates waiting for

Riding the day, every day into sunset
Finding the way back home

Once upon a night we`ll wake to the carnival of life
The beauty of this ride ahead such an incredible high
It`s hard to light a candle, easy to curse the dark instead
This moment the dawn of humanity
The last ride of the day

Wake up, Dead Boy
Enter adventureland
Tricksters, magicians will show you all that?s real
Careless jugglers, snakecharmers by your trail
Magic of a moment 
Abracadabra.</title>
